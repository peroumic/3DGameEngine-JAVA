# 3DGameEngine-JAVA
A game engine written in Java using the OpenGL library.
My first project in Java. Tried out different approaches, settled
on the ECS (Entity Component System), which through my eyes behaves
like a database and allows artistic freedom with entity creation
based on the componnents you add to the entity.
